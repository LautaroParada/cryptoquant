        burnt in Ethereum chain by executing transactions, introduced after 
        London upgrade. We provide the average amount of burnt fees per 
        transaction as fees_burnt_transaction_mean and the median amount as 
        fees_burnt_transaction_median. CQ provide the metrics in both ETH and 
        USD units. These metrics have data entries starting post to London 
        upgrade (block height 12965000, datetime 2021-08-05 12:33:42).
